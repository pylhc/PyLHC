Welcome to PyLHC's documentation!
=================================

PyLHC is a collection of python packages developed for analysis of LHC data.

Currently, this includes handler for tfs, yasp, sdds, tsv (timber), and hdf5 objects.

Further, a very nice plotting library has been developed by Riccardo which makes use of matplotlib
to give you nice figures.
