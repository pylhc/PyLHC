# pylhc Changelog

## Version 0.7.4

Changes in Machine Settings Info
 - Default behaviour for no knobs given: extract None.
 - Old behaviour of extracting all restored by giving `knobs = ["all"]`
 - Additional debug logging

## Version 0.7.3 

Fixes:
 - LSA to MADX sign convention
 - Better trim naming
 - check madx names for allowed characters
 - option to init all variables
 - machine settings info takes ISO time

## Version 0.7.2

Fix: Trim variables generated in the MAD-X script will make sure not to be longer than 47 characters (hard MAD-X limit), nor start with an underscore or a digit.

## Version 0.7.1

Fix: Will not attempt to write to disk knobs that were not found by LSA in the provided optics.

## Version 0.7.0

Added `LSA` knobs to `MAD-X` conversion capability: given LSA knobs and the optics they apply to, creates `.madx` files that will reproduce the knobs in simulation.

## Version 0.6.2

Added a flag to the `info` functionality of `pylhc.kickgroups` to display a copy-pastable list of kick files for the GUI to load at once.

## Version 0.6.1

Bugfixes in KickGroups:
  - Better error message when there are no kicks in group.
  - Find correct planes in lists of data.
  - Renamed functions to `list` and `info`.

## Version 0.6.0

Added KickGroups functionality: load available kick groups in a folder, display their relevant information; and do the same for all kick files in a given kickgroup.

## Version 0.5.0

Removed `irnl_rdt_correction`. Is now in https://github.com/pylhc/irnl_rdt_correction

## Version 0.4.1

Minor bugfixes in `machine_settings_info`.

- Added:
  - `time` and `start_time` can now be given as `AccDatetime`-objects.
  
- Fixed:
  - `trims` variable is initialized as `None`. Was not initialized if no 
  trims were found, but used later on.
    

## Version 0.4.0

* Add Zenodo DOI to README by @fsoubelet in https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC/pull/89
* Adds check for non-existing knobs by @JoschD in https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC/pull/90
* Update CI by @fsoubelet in https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC/pull/91
* Lsa with timerange by @JoschD in https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC/pull/92

Release `0.4.0` brings the trim-history option to the machine-info extractor.
To enable this, one needs to provide a `start_time`.
The return values are now organized into a dictionary.

Note: if one wishes to extend the `IRNL` correction script to a different accelerator, 
there are valuable pointers in the following 
[PR comment](https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC/pull/74#issuecomment-966212021).
