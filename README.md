This package is a collection of useful scripts and tools for the Optics Measurements and Corrections group (OMC) at CERN.

## Documentation

- Autogenerated docs via ``sphinx`` can be found on <https://pylhc.github.io/PyLHC/>.
- General documentation of the OMC-Teams software on <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/BEABP/OMC>

## Getting Started

This  package is `Python 3.7+` compatible, but not yet deployed to PyPI.
The best way to install is through pip and VCS:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC
pip install /path/to/PyLHC
```

Or simply from the online master branch, which is stable:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC.git#egg=pylhc
```

After installing, codes can be run with either `python -m pylhc.SCRIPT --FLAG ARGUMENT` or calling path to the `.py` file directly.

Note: some of the scripts access functionality only available on the CERN Technical Network.
To use those, you should make sure to install the relevant extra dependencies with `pip install path/to/Pylhc[tech]`.

## Description

This package provides tools which can be useful for working with accelerators, but are not neccessary for optics measurements analysis.
The latter tools can be found in [omc3](https://github.com/pylhc/omc3) (Python 3.7+) or [Beta-Beat.src](https://github.com/pylhc/Beta-Beat.src) (Python 2.7)

## Functionality

- *Forced DA Analysis* - Script to analyse forced DA. ([**forced_da_analysis.py**](pylhc/forced_da_analysis.py))
- *Machine Settings Info* - Prints an overview over the machine settings at a given time. ([**machine_settings_info.py**](pylhc/machine_settings_info.py))
- *HTCondor Job Submitter* - Allows to generate jobs based on a templates and submit them to HTCondor. ([**job_submitter.py**](pylhc/job_submitter.py))
- *BSRT Logger* and *BSRT Analysis* - Saves data coming straight from LHC BSRT FESA class and allows subsequent analysis. ([**BSRT_logger.py**](pylhc/BSRT_logger.py) & [**BSRT_analysis.py**](pylhc/BSRT_analysis.py) )

## Quality checks

- Unit and accuracy tests are run automatically through CI [Github Actions](https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC/actions). See our workflows in this [readme](.github/workflows/README.md).
- Additional checks for code-complexity, design-rules, test-coverage and duplication are made through [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/pylhc/PyLHC).
- Pull requests implementing functionality or fixes are merged into the master branch after passing CI, and a reviewer's approval.

### Hints for Developers

In case you want to contribute to `PyLHC`'s development, you should install it in `editable` mode:
```
git clone https://github.com/pylhc/PyLHC
pip install --editable PyLHC
```

You can install extra dependencies (as defined in `setup.py`) suited to your use case with the following commands:
```
pip install --editable PyLHC[tech]
pip install --editable PyLHC[test]
pip install --editable PyLHC[test,doc]
pip install --editable PyLHC[all]
```

Open an issue, make your changes in a branch and submit a pull request.
